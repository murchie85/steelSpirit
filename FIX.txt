ENEMY SPAWN REDO

DO IN PARTS:


PART ONE: PERIPHERY SPAWN, WITHIN A GIVEN AREA
- only works for air vechicles

1. Create: Modify: Delete spawn zone 
2. Create 
		Drag spawn zone (make transparent)
		select enemy and place
			- objective: none, clearout...etc
			- number
			- waves
			- duration between waves
3. Modify
		 cycle zones left/right
		 click on enemy to remove
4. Delete
		click delete button for this zone

SAVED AS ENEMY LIST WITH THESE ADDED
LOADED:
	   create zone if not exist


enemy.spawnMe         = True
enemy.spawnNumber     = 1
enemy.spawn_objective = destroyBase
enemy.spawn_coords    = [(),(),] 
enemy.spawn_wave      = 2
enemy.spawn_range     = 'small','med','big'
enemy.spawn_periphery = True




WHAT DO I WANT?

SPAWN AT EDGE OF PERIPHERY:  IF PLAYER IS IN THIS GRID AREA AND/OR FOR  GIVEN OBJECTIVE

SPAWN AT EDGE OF PERIPHERY:  WITHIN A GIVEN TIME FRAME AND OBJECTIVE

SPAWN ON LOCATION: AT A GIVEN OBJECTIE 


POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS:

SPAWN PLACER: 

...check notes 



What i want to do is create a way to spawn enemies:

Continuous Spawn - at a given point and/or given time spawn enemies, then after that time spawn them again for as many as specified by user.

Or/And

Continuous Spawn periphery - at a given point where the player is and/or given time spawn enemies, so they appear just outside the players view, so they come into view quite quickly (will set hteir field of view high)

or/and

Spawn on location: enemies spawn at a location for a given objective/phase in the level.











TO DO 

- L1, L2(groundblocking)
- Enemies (include objects)
- Spawn/target Zones
- change l1 to be dict in active object so it  has terrain info



- Add more intense weapons
