Pixel geep https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uX9r5J1WYko
Look for concrete samples
- Terrain should be smaller...maybe...think about it (small view like raiden or big like under attack)


## UNITS TO ADD

- DOUBLE BARREL 2 SHOTS SAME TIME
- Shrapnell flying out should land and puff
- Surfacing sub

## CODE CHANGES

- Enemy Respawn
- Third layer with paralax canv Speed (possibly cloud cover) - canvas transparent. MOD to pick layer size

- ADD ALLY
- ADD ALLY LOGIC
- ALLY COMMAND
- improved explosion animations
- APC
- Procedural level generator (start with enemy)

- Delta time to keep speed constant



- QUALITY CONTROL - Does it still have slug throwing SHmup feel? Are graphics isometric a bit
- CLEARLY SIGNPOST: FREE MODE <-->LOCKON MODE
- CLEARLY SIGNPOST: Boosting, side dodge etc

## CONSIDER ONLY

Tanks can only move in 12 directions maybe 18 making animations look more 3d
bomb self frag

## CONTROLLER 

- Hold button to lock on and turn otherwise free roam
- Facing south when shooting inverts u/d
- Probably want lockon/lockoff buttons all to be the same - controll still feels offf, storyboard

## SECONDARY TO BE GROOMED 


- Tank bumping over - gives realistic feel, with dust thrown up by treds
BETA TESTING
- Add movement pivot around center point when not in lockon mode/ OR MODIFY LOCKON to pivot around center mass...adding more 
	 - Add variations as schemas to test for beta testing


ENEMIES TO ADD: 

GIGA TANK - COME FROM UNDER GROUND
GIGA TURRET / CANNON 
SHIPS IN PORTS



- BOSS Slog it battles, that is slugfest and boss chases you about screen
- BOSS all aim for his core at the same time

- Consider reducing sizes of sprites to make it more realistic (tanks,mlrs especially)
- UPGRADE TREE
	- MAINMENU UNLOCK
	- LONGER BOOST TIME - Dual fire
- Might wanna use the camToLocation from droneCommander
- tanks to be smaller, so they can roll out as a pack
- stretch - 'GOOD JOB' when enemy count ticks to zero in sector
- Check Godzilla for human type ideas
- Shmup into open world
- Redo omega storm including canvas
- Redo title text explaination with ai art gen - move to after game
- Boss target-points flash/Highlight
- Shmup maybe not needed not for a long time anyway
- release with twitter acc, automate reshares..adds, get list of shmups
- load assets by lv
- clean map editor, so it always checks number of rows, cols match actual in metaTiles 
- Light source
	- all shadows must change respectively
	- Shadow wonky fix
	- shadow that rotates about an origin point and not revolve around the player?
- chaff efficiency (limit number of chaff on screen) or just go with a ball of particles (save trans)
- movement wind/streak effect
- More ground damagable structs
- NAVI ALLY, include story etc


## GUI IDEAS

	- Minimap bottom right?
	- GUI LAYOUT: HEALTH, INFO PANEL like DC
	- GUI LAYOUT: RIGHT VIDEO SCREEN FOR FAST, INGAME POPUP SCREEN FOR BLUR





## FEEDBACK FROM PEOPLE 

```
Looking good! Some improvements if I may: Tile variants in the grass, it would break up the repetition, you can see a grid.
Shadows for everything.
The player movement seems a little stiff, could be a little slower to stop when the player stops moving.
```

The way I solved this was by splitting the tiles into chunks, then pre render the chunks and blit the ones that are shown to the screen right now. This will make the tile rendering time so insignificant you won't notice it.

Also, you probably don't want to use a dictionary, a list (or an array) is much more suitable for such cases, especially if the keys are ints anyways.

In your case, since the map doesn't even change, the chunks can be arbitrarily large so just try different sizes and see what works best

# ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA 

KEEP: Currently, tank battles feel shmupy, lots of damage, carnage. 

1. Must have, Lots to dodge, lots to shoot, a lot happening.
2. Must have MULTIPLE LAYERS
3. MUST BE differentiable from the 10000 other Shmups (RPG element, Summon attack, Gameplay mechanics???). Joint teams.Shmup/Open pivot
4. Dodging huge boss like bullet hell stream
5. Review videos







## UNDER CONSIDERATOIN

[`JOINT SPECIAL ATTACK`, `Shmup intro`, `slow Underdefeat shmup levels`,   ]




# ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA GLOBAL

- QUALITY CONTROL - Does it still have slug throwing Shmup feel? Are graphics isometric a bit
- Keep it different from Gyro blade, it should be fast, manic and fun. Not desert strike
- Lots of variety on screen, AA, planes, ATB, etc
- Good Map Detail 
- FLOW FUGE MODE: Zoom to area with dog fight tailers...jump into lockon mode..clean up
- Visuals still FAR below par - have they been improved to look nice? Think is a boss fight got that proboctor feel?

	- Coordinator [GAME CLASS] (managing the main scenes/phase of the game)

		- Intro 

		- Title screen

		- Start Menu

		-  Game Logic [LEVEL CLASS]

			- Two main states: 

				- Init
					- Setup background, add enemies to the field
				- Run
					- Runs the bullets, map, enemies, players functions

		- Map editor ***(Complete)***

			- Create new map

			- Load Map

## STORY BOARDING




....One ship... just one ship, thats all it takes to destroy a system
fermi paradox
we know its coming, other planets already destroyed
immune system, turns them on to each other
earth is so yesterday.. (make it in game jibes)


- EARTH HAS COME A LONG WAY SINCE THE FORMATION OF A WEIGHED FEDERATED ALLIANCE
  (SPACE SHIPS, MANS SHAKING HANDS)
  - SSW 1 SSW 2
  - propoganda, 

- EARTH EXPANDED OUT FURTHER INTO THE HEAVENS 
	 - PICTURES OF SHIPS BUILDING HABBITATES

- FINALLY THE GREATEST BREAKTHROUGH CAME AT OUR FEET AND NOT IN THE STARS
	- GENETIC ENGINEEERING , BABY HYBRIDS

- NEW VARIATIONS TOOK OFF IN THE NEW PLANETS, 
	- MARTIAN FOX LIKE CREATIONS
	- VENUSIAN RABBIT GIRLS
	- TITAN CAT GIRLS etc

- The population of the solar system grew to 50 billion 

- New racial tensions soon fueled civil wars

- Nation leaders nearly brought us to the brink until the 'veterans' stood in and brought about the peace

- Now we stand at a new dawn, the veterans have retired, with a gap for the new breed








## MOVEMENT STRETCH CONSIDERATIONS 

- MOVEMENT EXPERIMENT CONSIDERATIONS
 	- LOCKON SHOULDN'T FACE TARGET, cus you plough into it, should put you into jink mode, which you can swivel holding jink button
	- Maybe just slow down when enemies are in range (unless you boost)
	- Consider shooting puts you in Jink mode to strafe like under defeat
	- Consider holding down lockon, when you let go, you are just in jink mode
	- Make dodging a big element too zipping past until you get to a good part
	- Jinkshoot spray and pray by slowing forward motion is a must.. to make chaff dodge work it should be in non shooting mode..you can lob missiles maybe
	- Fine control, so rotation is inversed if facing down, (but only if r,l isn't already pressed)
	- Want to be able to dodge enemy in shmup style, lockon camera centering clamp may be needed
		- this makes jink manual
		- more thinking required, because to get that flow, its hard if there are enemies in front and beside


## PIXEL ART 

- SCULPT not draw
- DEFINE A LIGHT SOURCE
- start simple
- ask why i'm adding another colour
